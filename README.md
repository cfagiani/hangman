Hangman
========

This is a simple implementation of hangman meant to be used to practice programming. The hangman_solution.py file has a 
working implementation whereas hangman.py has a number of TODO statements that walk a user through how to complete
the implementation using the functions that are already provided.

Future revisions:
* refactoring to prompt for new game and keep track of win/loss & player name
* refactoring to include file/io
